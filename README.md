<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project:

This is a Streamlit deployed Web Application, used to analyze and compare stocks. Mass psychology's effects may be one of the factors driving the market. We can measure and use to predict market movement with surprising accuracy levels. We used the the social media and news contents for scrapping real-time information.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the literature references.

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks that we built our project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
* [Flair](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair)
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started:

We have used a pre-trained sentiment analysis model from the **flair**(DistilBERT Model) library. This model splits the text into character-level tokens and uses the DistilBERT model to make predictions of words, that the network has never seen before can assign it a sentiment. 

DistilBERT is a distilled version of the powerful BERT transformer model — which in-short means — it is a ‘small’ model (only 66 million parameters), and is still super powerful. We have used the flair model for calculating the **Prediction Score**. Prediction Score is a measure of how well the stock gone to be performing on the basis of past hour tweets. 

We are also comapring the input stock performance with two competitor stocks on a **NLTK** trained sentiment analysis model and parses the [FinViz](https://finviz.com/) stock screener for past one week news headlines.
